TreBor -- Tree-Based Detection of Borrowings in Lexicostatistic Datasets
========================================================================

This code uses different gain-loss mapping techniques to detect borrowings in lexicostatistic dataset.
The code will be later included as part of LingPy (https://github.com/lingpy/lingpy).

# Requirements

In order to be fully functionable, the code requires 
* NumPy (http://numpy.org), 
* SciPy (http://scipy.org), 
* Matplotlib (http://matplotlib.org), 
* Basemap (http://matplotlib.org/basemap/), and 
* the most recent version of LingPy (http://github.com/lingpy/lingpy).
